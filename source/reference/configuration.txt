.. setting:: cluster0

   *Type*: string


   Sets the :ref:`connection URI <mongodb-uri>` for the first cluster.
   The first cluster can serve as either the source or the destination
   in the sync process. Designate the source and destination clusters
   in the call to the :ref:`c2c-api-start` API endpoint.

   For more information on connecting ``mongosync``, see
   :ref:`Connections <c2c-connecting>`.

.. setting:: cluster1

   *Type*: string

   Use this option when running multiple instances of ``mongosync`` on
   a sharded cluster, to synchronize the shards individually.

   syncs.  To find the shard ID, use the :dbcommand:`listShards`
   command.

   HTTP API.

.. setting:: verbosity 

   *Type*: string

   *Default*: ``INFO``

   Sets the verbosity level to use in log messages.
