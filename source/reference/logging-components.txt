Logging Components
==================

Log entries use the ``componentName`` field to indicate the component that generated
the log message.

For example:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize: 5

   {
      "level":         "info",
      "serverID":      "0624a3e",
      "mongosyncID":   "coordinator",
      "componentName": "CHECKPOINT",
      "time":          "2022-07-13T17:44:09.837830382-04:00",
      "message":       "starting Mongosync from change event application phase."
   }
