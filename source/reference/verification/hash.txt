===========================
Verify with Hash Comparison
===========================

You can verify sync by comparing MD5 hashes of collections synced from the
source cluster to the destination cluster. While hash comparison ensures
that the destination cluster has received all changes from the source, the
:dbcommand:`dbHash` command locks the cluster, preventing additional writes
until it completes.

.. note::

   Hash comparison is not possible with sharded clusters. It also does not
   work for standalone servers and replica sets that use MongoDB 4.4 or earlier
   releases, since the document field order can vary.

If you need to sync a sharded cluster or an older release of MongoDB, or
if the locks are unacceptable for your application workload, use a different
:ref:`verification method <c2c-verify-method>`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Retrieve the Source Hash

      Run the :dbcommand:`dbHash` command on the source cluster.
      In the ``collections`` field, list each collection included
      in the sync.  Then, return the ``md5`` output field:
      
      .. io-code-block::
      
         .. input::
            :language: javascript
      
            db.runCommand({
               dbHash: 1,
               collections: [
                  "accounts.us_accounts",
                  "accounts.eu_accounts",
                  ...
               ]}).md5
      
         .. output::
            :language: text
      
            d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

       Note the hash.

   .. step:: Retrieve the Destination Hash

      Run the :dbcommand:`dbHash` command on the destination cluster.
      In the ``collections`` field, list each collection included
      in the sync.  Then, return the ``md5`` output field:
      
      .. io-code-block::
      
         .. input::
            :language: javascript
      
            db.runCommand({
               dbHash: 1,
               collections: [
                  "accounts.us_accounts",
                  "accounts.eu_accounts",
                  ...
               ]}).md5
      
         .. output::
            :language: text
      
            d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

       Note the hash.

    .. step:: Compare the Hashes

       If the ``md5`` field of the :dbcommand:`dbHash` command returns the
       same value on the source cluster as it does on the destination cluster,
       the sync was successful.
